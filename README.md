# infoVote
this is a voting website for the computer science class in my school

the general idea is, that each student / groop of a few students is going to upload their projekt to a website, where each student can then vote, which project was the best.

setup:

import a database (either demo.sql or empty.sql) as signin.sql.

the demo database has one admin user, which is katze with the password katze. To create new admins you have to manualy create an entry with the ID of the user, which should be an admin.
